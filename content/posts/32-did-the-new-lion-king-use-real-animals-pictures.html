    <p><strong>32+ Did The New Lion King Use Real Animals Pictures</strong>. In the 1994 lion king, pumbaa the warthog is a charming, cuddly cartoon doofus. This is why, why that matters, and what we can do to help.</p>

    <h3>Everyone keeps talking about how damn realistic the animals in the new lion king movie look:</h3>
    <p>In what makes voice acting resonate, for starters, and in the strangeness of hearing animals emote vocally we also get the most lively deviations from the expressive realness of these animals—unless, that is, warthogs do happy dances in real life. It was a combination of other sounds. I think it would have been perfect if they did the right voices as in. While the animals in the lion king remake look more realistic than in the original, the new disney film still ignored some facts.</p>
