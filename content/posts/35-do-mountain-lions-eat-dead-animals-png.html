                Once a lion has decided to attack, they have already decided that the gain of a meal outweighs the they do hide their kill in piles of leaves, and whenever i run, and smell a dead dear near my trial i&#039;m. Their dogs always followed them, but on this occasion, a mountain lion decided that he wanted to stalk the dogs (you&#039;ll see the dogs in the background watching). Especially if they are the type deer like to eat, and the smell of blood from sick, injured, dead, or newborn animals will attract mountain lions.

    <h3>Unfortunately for f99, her attempt to eat.</h3>
    <p>In which case it is a fair question but if you know mountain lions you will know that the are not the sort of animal to attack and eat humans. Some mountain lions will actually develop a taste for porcupines, and expertly skin the animals after slaying them. Mountain lions normally eat things like deer and sheep, but will eat anything from mice to elk. Except the mountain lion, which is now dead.</p>
