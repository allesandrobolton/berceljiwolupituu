                I made this quiz so that people can know which animal they most likely be if they were a animal.i think the best thing about this quiz is it is fun and free. All these animals have one quality which i find to be a very interesting quality in my opinion and it&#039;s the or perhaps i should use my personality type in determining which animal i might have been if i was actually brought into the world as an animal. Even human beings are afraid of the king of the jungle.

    <h3>In the cool of the evening, as the setting sun bids the day good night and the moon rises majestically into the beautiful starry sky, i would take a stroll to the cool water of the rushing river, parting the reeds and lush green ferns as i wend my way to the gently.</h3>
    <p>Would i be a donkey belonging to a gypsy selling heather, making. Now that i&#039;m older, i completely understand. It could also be a dominance thing. The lion was so tickled at the idea of the mouse being able to help him, that he lifted up his paw and let him go.</p>
